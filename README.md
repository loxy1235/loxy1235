# Context-Based Access Control implemented on a login website

## Overview
On Implemenation of context-based access control for a login website various factors can be taekn into account but for this project, location is the main factor of consideration. Various functional requirements are to be considered to get the system to prevent malware attacks therefore enhancing the private network's security.

These functional requirements include;
- [ ] User Authentication and Authorization is the first where Implementing a robust user authentication mechanism to 
      verify user identities during login and Upon successful authentication, authorize users based on their roles and 
      contextual factors (in this project's case location)
- [ ] Session Management is necessary to maintain user sessions securely throughout their interaction with the website 
      and also to handle session timeouts, session termination, and re-authentication as needed.
- [ ] Audit Logging and Monitoring through Logging access events including successful logins, failed login attempts, and 
      access requests it's also necessary to monitor access patterns and anomalies to detect potential security breaches.
- [ ] Error Handling is necessary where Robust Error Messages help Implement clear and informative error messages for 
      users during login and access attempts. These messages should guide users on how to resolve issues (e.g., 
      incorrect credentials, blocked access).
- [ ] Integration Testing helps explore testing strategies beyond unit tests, including integration and system testing, 
      to validate the overall systemâ€™s ability to handle errors gracefully.

Tools and libraries to Implement CBAC


Creating a Login Website with Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)
Here's a breakdown of tools and libraries to implement CBAC on a simple login website using PHP and phpMyAdmin:

1. Website Creation Tools:
Frontend: You can choose from various options for creating the website's user interface (UI). Some popular choices include:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These fundamental web development languages offer full control over the website's look and feel. However, they require more coding knowledge.
Web Frameworks: Frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation can provide pre-built UI components and simplify website development.
Content Management Systems (CMS): Platforms like WordPress offer a user-friendly interface for creating websites without extensive coding. However, customizing CBAC features might require additional plugins or coding knowledge.
2. Backend (Server-Side):
PHP: This scripting language will handle user login, data processing, and communication with the database.
3. Database:
MySQL Database with phpMyAdmin: This is a great option for managing user data and access control settings.
4. CBAC Implementation:
Implementing Location-Based Access Control (LBAC) with IP Geolocation (PHP)
1.
Choose an IP Geolocation Service:
There are various free and paid IP geolocation services available. Here are two popular options:
MaxMind GeoIP2: https://www.maxmind.com/ (Offers a free tier with limited usage)
FreeGeoIP: https://freegeoip.io/ (Free service with limitations)
3. 
Install Required Libraries:
For both services, you'll likely need to use a library to interact with their API in PHP. Here are some options:
MaxMind GeoIP2: Provides a PHP library you can download from their website.
FreeGeoIP: You can use libraries like Guzzle or directly make API calls using cURL.
4. 
Login Script (index.php) - Modifications:
User Login Form: Maintain a form for username and password (if using password-based authentication).
IP Geolocation Integration:
PHP
// Include necessary library (replace with your chosen library)
require_once('path/to/geoip2.phar');
// Get user's IP address
$user_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
// Use the GeoIP2 library (replace with your library's usage)
$reader = new GeoIp2\DatabaseReader('path/to/GeoLite2-City.mmdb');
$record = $reader->city($user_ip);
// Extract relevant location data (replace with specific fields)
$country_code = $record['country']['iso_code'];
$city_name = $record['city']['name'];
// Alternatively, use FreeGeoIP API (replace with their API endpoint and parsing logic)
$ip_data = file_get_contents("https://api.freegeoip.app/json/$user_ip");
$ip_data = json_decode($ip_data, true);
$country_code = $ip_data['country_code'];
$city_name = $ip_deta['city'];
Use code with caution.

5. 
Definition of Authorized Locations:
Create an array or database table to store authorized locations within your organization (e.g., building names, floor numbers, or internal IP ranges).
PHP
$authorized_locations = [
  "Building A - Floor 1",
  "Building B - Floor 2",
  "192.168.1.0/24" // Example internal network IP range
];
Use code with caution.
content_copy
6. Access Control Logic:
PHP
// Check if user's location is authorized
$location_authorized = false;
// Example check based on country code and city (modify based on your needs)
if (in_array("$country_code - $city_name", $authorized_locations)) {
  $location_authorized = true;
}
else
{
  // Check if IP belongs to your internal network range (adapt based on your IP range)
  $ip_segments = explode('.', $user_ip);
  $network_address = implode('.', array_slice($ip_segments, 0, 3)) . ".0";
  if (in_array($network_address, $authorized_locations)) {
    $location_authorized = true;
  }
}
// Grant access or display error message
if ($location_authorized) {
  // User is authorized, proceed with login logic and redirection
} else {
  // User is not authorized, display error message
  echo "Access denied! Login allowed only from authorized locations.";
}
content_copy
7.
Remember:
Replace placeholders like library paths and location data extraction logic with your chosen service and library's specific requirements.
Adapt the access control logic to match your specific authorized locations format (e.g., building names, IP ranges).
final Implemention is proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
