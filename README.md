# Context-Based Access Control implemented on a login website

## Overview
On Implemenation of context-based access control for a login website various factors can be taekn into account but for this project, location is the main factor of consideration. Various functional requirements are to be considered to get the system to prevent malware attacks therefore enhancing the private network's security.

These functional requirements include;
- [ ] User Authentication and Authorization is the first where Implementing a robust user authentication mechanism to 
      verify user identities during login and Upon successful authentication, authorize users based on their roles and 
      contextual factors (in this project's case location)
- [ ] Session Management is necessary to maintain user sessions securely throughout their interaction with the website 
      and also to handle session timeouts, session termination, and re-authentication as needed.
- [ ] Audit Logging and Monitoring through Logging access events including successful logins, failed login attempts, and 
      access requests it's also necessary to monitor access patterns and anomalies to detect potential security breaches.
- [ ] Error Handling is necessary where Robust Error Messages help Implement clear and informative error messages for 
      users during login and access attempts. These messages should guide users on how to resolve issues (e.g., 
      incorrect credentials, blocked access).
- [ ] Integration Testing helps explore testing strategies beyond unit tests, including integration and system testing, 
      to validate the overall systemâ€™s ability to handle errors gracefully.
